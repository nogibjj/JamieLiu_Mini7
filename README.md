## What This CLI Does

The Rent Calculator CLI helps you compute:

1. **Total Money Spent**: The total amount youâ€™ll spend on rent and utilities over a specific rental period, accounting for any free months.
2. **Net Monthly Expense**: The average monthly cost over the entire rental period, taking into account free months for both rent and utilities.

You input the total number of months, monthly rent, free months, monthly utilities, and free months for utilities. The CLI will output both the total money spent and your average monthly expenses, providing you with a quick financial overview of your rental agreement.

## Dependencies

The Rent Calculator CLI uses **Clap** for command-line argument parsing.
